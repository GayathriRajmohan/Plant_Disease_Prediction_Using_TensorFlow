# Plant_Disease_Prediction_Using_TensorFlow
## PlantDiseaseDection
Develop a plant disease detection system using TensorFlow and Streamlit to accurately identify various diseases affecting plants from images. The system should efficiently classify images of plant leaves as healthy or diseased,The goal is to empower farmers and agricultural stakeholders with a user-friendly tool for early detection and management of plant diseases, ultimately enhancing crop productivity and reducing agricultural losses.


## Dataset
[Download the dataset  from here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset)

## Steps to Run the Project

step1:create a virtual Environment in python & activate using follwing command
```
python -m venv ./ven

```
step2:Install all modules in requirements.txt file

step3:Preprocess the dataset

step4:Split the dataset into training and testing

step5:Train the CNN model using training data

step6:Fit the Model and Perform Evaluation

step8:Make sure that app.py and training model are present in same working directory

step9:In cmd/terminal type streamlit run main.py

step10:Then Upload the images in streamlit and get predictions
